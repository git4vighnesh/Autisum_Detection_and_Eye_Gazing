# Autisum_Detection_and_Eye_Gazing
 machine learning procedure for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification and prediction ,   Thus it overcome the existing problem.  In order to increase the performance and accuracy of our model we use Adabooster algorithm                By utilizing random forest(RF) , Support vector machine(SVM)
